A PostgreSQL ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) written in Python.

**PySQL** showcases the power of metaclasses in Python to create ergonomic
APIs. The goal of this project is to make database operations feel as if they
are natively integrated into Python. By leveraging metaclass magic and
abstracting away the complexities of database interactions, we can provide a
more seamless and intuitive developer experience.
